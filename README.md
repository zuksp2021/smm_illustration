How to Ensure You’re Last on Google?
To do this, you need to understand how Google ranks sites at the top and then do everything the opposite way.

But we already know this, and our site is on the first page of search results. So, there’s no need to read this text. Let’s move on.

No?
You’re still here?

Then here’s some bad news for you, though I’m sure it’s no surprise. Your site isn’t interesting to either visitors or Google. Hurts, doesn’t it?

But don’t worry. This can be fixed!

So, how does Google behave in a nutshell? Why does this bulldog see some sites as tasty sausages, catching their scent from afar and not letting go once it bites down, while it passes by others as if there’s no treasure trove of texts, charts, and tables?

Ready?

There is, folks, a particular scent this dog responds to. It ranks sites at the top, primarily based on…

drum roll, please…

visitor behavior on the site.
That’s it.

If someone visits and immediately leaves, it means the site didn’t offer anything valuable for that search query. If someone stays and even explores other pages on the site, it means the site was interesting.

And now the most important part. If the main product of any search engine is to provide the most valuable information to people, then…

YES!
The time a visitor spends on your site, and especially if they leave a comment or share the content, is the main reason search engines rank your site at the top!

And now, let’s talk about the term «Bounce Rate.»
If 10 people visit your site based on a search query, and all ten stay, with half of them leaving comments or sharing the content, that site will rank higher than a site that gets 1000 visitors who immediately leave. And the second site may even have 1000 pages, while the first has only three. Google considers that if visitors bounce off the content immediately, then those 1000 pages are weak and irrelevant. Why would we push that site to the top? And vice versa, three pages from which none of the ten visitors leave – that’s what you need for the first page of search results. Bounce rate is the sausage scent for the bulldog that it reacts to instantly and instinctively. Because that’s the essence of the beast. Its primary function is to deliver what’s needed. If there are few bounces, the content is NECESSARY. And vice versa.

So, conclusions.
«Create content not for Google, but for the visitor.»
By the way, Google itself writes this in bold in its recommendations for promotion!
Impossible! We’re used to thinking that the main tricks should be hidden from everyone and not for everyone. Why is it so simple?
The answer is also simple, folks:
Google is INTERESTED in you providing very, very, very interesting and engaging content for visitors.
And again, WHY?

And again, the answer is simple. Remember search engines like AltaVista, HotBot, Yahoo… and hundreds of others that we’ve already forgotten how to spell correctly. Why did they die?

The answer is again simple. People stopped using them!
Why?
Because the product they delivered was low-quality, irrelevant, often filled with paid ads on the first pages, and to find something, you had to dig through not one or two pages like on Google today, but a hundred. Yes, yes! Don’t believe it? Ask your parents.

Alright, we’ve agreed. To reduce bounce rates,
content must be interesting.

And what does «interesting» mean?

Think about it for a minute yourself. Have you ever tried to meet a girl on the street? What’s the likelihood of success if you approach her with something banal like
«I’d like to get to know you» or «I like you, you’re so beautiful, let’s get to know each other»?
It’s the same story.

Remember a dull, unwise conversation partner without a sense of humor?
From them, you won’t hear anything unexpected. No fresh perspective on things. No overturning of stereotypes or irony and humor. Their text will be banal, predictable. Content that doesn’t bring anything new, has no new point of view or playfulness, is not interesting. THAT’S IT. Banality with a serious face, even in large quantities, won’t beat content in one paragraph that’s unexpected, fresh, with humor and playfulness.

People are rarely played with. The interesting and unexpected is always a game. Only our mothers and the best teachers had the love and patience to play with us, shielding us from all the world’s problems during those thirty minutes of interaction.

People will ALWAYS respond to originality, a new perspective, non-banality, humor… playfulness. Because to give that, the giver first needs to make an effort. With love, patience, and playfulness toward the conversation partner and content. This will always be valued by people. Why?

Because, folks, we are Human!
)

And we should create content for humans, in a human way. Not for robots and machine code. In a human way? What does that mean?
With love, with playfulness, with humor, with irony, non-banally…

Remember how often we encounter people like Mark Twain, O. Henry, Harry Harrison, Einstein, Feynman… who could talk about serious things playfully and not with faces as serious as bricks?
Not many, right?
)

So. Content and advertising with an unusual perspective or playfulness are the only things that will make a person stay and explore your site. And that means they’ll pull your site to the surface from the depths of the internet ocean like a bullet.

Can we boast of creating such content? Well, that would be very bold.
Let’s put it this way: even if it’s just a little, we try to do it!
And sometimes we succeed.
